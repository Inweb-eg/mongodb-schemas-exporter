# Python MongoDB Schema Extractor

This Python script connects to an existing MongoDB database with multiple collections and exports their schemas to separate JSON files.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- PyMongo library (https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html)

## Installation

1. Install PyMongo:

```sh
pip install pymongo
```
Use code with caution.
Clone or download this repository : https://github.com/spctec/mongodb-schemas-exporter.git

## Usage
Replace the placeholder values in schemas_exporter.py:

MONGO_URI: Your MongoDB connection string.
DATABASE_NAME: Your MongoDB database name.
Run the script:

```sh
python schemas_exporter.py
```

Use code with caution.

## Output

The script will create separate JSON files named collection_name_schema.json for each collection in the database, containing the inferred schema information.
